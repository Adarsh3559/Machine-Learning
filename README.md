# Machine-Learning

The used dateset was from previous loan applications, tasks doen are cleaning the data, and applying different classification algorithm on data.

following algorithms are used to build the models:

1. k-Nearest Neighbour

2. Decision Tree

3. Support Vector Machine

4. Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

1. Jaccard index

2. F1-score

3. LogLoass


The model were trained on Loan_Train.CSV and they were tested on different dataset i.e. Loan_Test.CSV
